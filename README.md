# IPL-Winning Team-Predicor

Third Task in Internpe Internship

# Task 3 - IPL Winning Team Prediction

# Aim: 

This project aims to predict the scores of IPL (Indian Premier League) cricket matches using machine learning techniques.This predictor can estimate the winning probability of both the teams. The project has been deployed using Streamlit, allowing users to interact with the predictor through a user-friendly web interface.

# Steps:
Data pre-processing, Data cleaning, Data Visualization and Model Training, Model Testing and Deployment are the key fundamentals of this task.

Exploratory Data Analysis: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) helpedto gain insights into the dataset. Visualizations helped to understand the distribution of different parameters and identify any outliers or correlations.

Data Preprocessing: Ensuring data quality, I performed preprocessing tasks, including checking missing values, feature selection and data partitioning for training and testing purposes.

Model building: I have Used Logistic Regression algorithm to predict probability of winning of a team.

Prediction and Evaluation: The model is tested. Accuracy  score of the model is 80%.


# key highlights:
It has user-friendly interface, which allows cricket enthusiasts to interact with the predictor effortlessly. I have deployed the project using Streamlit, a Python library for building web applications. Through a web interface, users can input the necessary information such as team names, venue, innings, overs, runs, and wickets. With a single click, the predictor provides the probability of winning of both the teams.
